The instructions to run each application separately are on the Readme.md of the respective folders, or you can use docker to run the applications:

## Getting Started

First, run the applications using docker compose:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Note that you will need to install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/windows-install/) if you don't have it installed.

After that you can access the backend documentation:

The frontend application you can access on: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
